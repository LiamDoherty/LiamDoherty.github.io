<h1> Shooty Squad</h1>
<div class = "description">Shooty squad is an online multiplayer first person shooter I developed and released to steam. This project was created and coded solely by myself, over the course of 6 months. Most of the art assets are also produced by me, with game design and level design also my responsibility. This is the first title I shipped as a solo indie developer ! </p>

<h1> Other Projects</h1>
<div class = "description">In my free time on the weekends I love to challenge myself to improve my game design skills by prototyping. My goal is to both improve my speed at prototyping and also get better at finding fun and unique game mechanics. I upload all of these games to my <a href= "https://gamejolt.com/@TastyLempons/games"> game jolt</a> account.
