	<div id = "shortBio"> Hello, <br>
  I'm a game developer with over 3 years game development experience. My strongest skills in game development are programming, but I also enjoy graphic design and 3D modelling. I have shipped games for mobile and PC. Most recently I released Shooty Squad which was my first game made as a solo indie develeoper. I am currently working as a freelance graphic designer creating designs for streamers.</div>
